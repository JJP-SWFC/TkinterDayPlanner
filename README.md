# TkinterDayPlanner
This is a relatively poorly made day planner made using the library tkinter for python. I have deliberately not used external libraries so there's no requirements.txt file.

Note: It's a bit broken at the moment and I don't feel a need to fix it so don't use it
# Usage
Just run main.py and the rest should be pretty self-explanatory
